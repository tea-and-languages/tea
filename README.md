Tea and Languages
=================

Theresa V. Foley

Abstract
--------

This book is a collection of programming langauge implementations that are meant to be read.
Each implementation strives for simplicity, so that you can casually read them while sitting down with a cup of tea (or coffee, or whatever you like).

The implementations are presented as *literate programs*, such that the code is interwoven with text that explains the intent.
Things are presentd in the order that we hope best explains them to the reader, rather than the order that is dictated by a compiler.

The text is written as a short course in language design and implementation, but such pedagogy is not out primary goal.
Rather, out goal is to share the admiration we have for language implementations that are elegant, simple, and parsiomnious: those that do more with less.
