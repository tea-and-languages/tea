Tea and Languages
=================

by Dr. Theresa V. Foley

Introduction
------------

This book is a collection of programming langauge implementations that are meant to be read.
Each implementation strives for simplicity, so that you can casually read them while sitting down with a cup of tea (or coffee, or whatevery you like).

The implementations are presented as *literate programs*, such that the code is interwoven with text that explains the intent.
Things are presentd in the order that I hope best explains them to the reader, rather than the order that is dictated by a compiler.

The text is written as a short course in language design and implementation, but such pedagogy is not my primary goal.
Rather, my goal is to share the admiration I have for language implementations that are elegant, simple, and parsiomnious: those that do more with less.
